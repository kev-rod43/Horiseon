# Horiseon

## Project description 
The Horiseon webpage was brought to me fully functional except with one minor bug with a link functionality. My job was to fix said bug, and to also to refactor the source code so that it follows the DRY principle better, and so that non-semantic elements can be replaced with semantic ones if needed for better accessibility. I introduced said changes without changing the UI/UX for the typical user by maintaining the same appearance of  the website pre changes.
Through completing this projected I gained the following:
• Knowledge on fundamental best practices for utilizing the proper HTML elements that are semantic.
•Experience on grouping elements that follow the same style rules by creating a meaningful class name so that CSS rules can be more concise and self-explaining.
 •Knowledge of the importance of constantly checking my work 
•Practice in working with awareness of how one must implement changes while taking into consideration what work must proceed said changes so that bugs are kept at a minimum.
